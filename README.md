Rebuilding the website in my 'web-app' repository into a react app

What's coming next: 

  - I've learned to stop using the HTML table element and replace it with [div elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html), so why am I still displaying the roster content as a table when thats no longer a limitation?
    - To change that I'm going to work on altering the display to resemble a card-like template, maybe resembling a baseball card or something similar. (Proposed 11/14/19)
