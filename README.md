What's coming next: 

  - So I've learned to stop using the HTML table element and replace it with [div elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html), but why am I still displaying the roster content   as a table?
    - To change that I'm going to work on changing the display format to resemble a card-like template, maybe resembling a baseball card or something similar.
