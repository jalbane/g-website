Rebuilding the website in my 'web-app' repository into a react app

What's coming next: 

  - I've learned to stop using the HTML table element and replace it with [div elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html), so why am I still displaying the roster content as a table when thats no longer a limitation?
    - To change that I'm going to work on altering the display to resemble a card-like template, maybe resembling a baseball card or something similar. (~~Proposed~~ Added 11/14/19)
    - [View before change was made](https://gifyu.com/image/vko0)
    
  - Planning on changing a player card to show their character class instead of character role, ie. 'Fire Mage' instead of 'Fire Damage'.
    I do like the idea of having their role displayed so you can see the team composition, but I'd like to replace it with an icon that
    stands out much more. (Proposed 11/16/19)
